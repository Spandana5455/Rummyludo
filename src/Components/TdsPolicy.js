        The Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) policy is a critical aspect of playing online rummy, impacting players’ winnings. In India, TDS is applicable when a player's net winnings exceed ₹10,000 in a financial year, at a standard rate of 30%.
        </p>
        <p className="para">
        When a player wins a cash prize, the rummy platform deducts TDS from the winnings before disbursing the remaining amount. For example, if a player wins ₹15,000 with an entry fee of ₹500, the taxable amount is ₹14,500, leading to a TDS deduction of ₹4,350.
        </p>
        <p className="para">
        Players must provide their Permanent Account Number (PAN) during registration for TDS compliance. After the deduction, the platform issues a TDS certificate, which serves as proof of tax deducted and can be used for filing income tax returns.
        </p>
        <p className="para">
        It's essential for players to understand their responsibilities regarding TDS and ensure they report their gaming income accurately when filing taxes. By staying informed about TDS regulations, players can enjoy a seamless rummy experience without unexpected tax liabilities.
