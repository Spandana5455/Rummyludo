                        <p className='para'>Rummy is a versatile card game that offers several engaging formats to cater to players of all skill levels. Each format has its unique rules and gameplay style, enhancing the overall experience and keeping the game fresh and exciting. Below, we explore some of the most popular rummy game formats.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1. Points Rummy </h3>
                        <p className='para'>Points Rummy is one of the fastest and most straightforward formats, ideal for quick games. Each card carries a specific point value, with numbered cards worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) worth 10 points, and Aces worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on the player’s choice. The game continues until one player declares, meaning they have completed their sets and sequences. The remaining players calculate their points based on the cards left in their hands, and the player with the lowest points wins the round. The simplicity and speed of Points Rummy make it popular for casual play and for those looking to enjoy quick rounds without extensive setup or strategy.                    </p>
                        <h3>2. Pool Rummy                     </h3>
                        <p className='para'>Pool Rummy adds a layer of strategy to the game by introducing a limit on the number of points players can accumulate. It is usually played with either 101 or 201 points, depending on the agreed-upon rules. Players aim to keep their scores below the specified limit, and the game continues until one player exceeds it, leading to their elimination. The last remaining player wins the game. This format encourages players to be strategic about the cards they pick and discard, as managing points becomes crucial to avoid elimination. The competitive nature of Pool Rummy appeals to players who enjoy a more strategic and long-term game.                     </p>
                        <h3>3. Deals Rummy                     </h3>
                        <p className='para'>Deals Rummy involves a fixed number of chips or points distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. Players play a predetermined number of deals, and after each deal, scores are calculated based on the cards left in hand. The player with the lowest score at the end of all deals wins. This format allows for deeper strategies and a more prolonged engagement, as players must consider their performance over multiple rounds rather than just a single game. Deals Rummy combines elements of both Points and Pool Rummy, making it a favorite among serious rummy enthusiasts.                     </p>
                        <h3>4. Indian Rummy                     </h3>
                        <p className='para'>Indian Rummy is a popular variant that typically requires players to form at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence that does not use any jokers. This format is often played with two decks of cards and incorporates jokers as wild cards, which can be used to complete sequences or sets. The requirement for a pure sequence adds a strategic element, as players must carefully manage their cards to meet this condition. The combination of skill and luck in Indian Rummy has made it a beloved game across the country.                     </p>
