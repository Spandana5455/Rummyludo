                    <h3>How to Play and Rules of Points Rummy ?</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li className="li-points">Points Rummy is a popular variation of the classic rummy game, played between 2 to 6 players. The objective is to form valid sequences and sets while minimizing the points in your hand. The game setup includes a standard 52-card deck with jokers, 13 cards each, and card values such as face cards, numbers, and jokers. Players aim to eliminate as many ungrouped cards as possible to avoid high points when another player declares.</li>
                        <li className="li-points">
                            The game involves drawing and discarding phases, with the goal being to improve your hand and form valid sequences and sets. To declare, a player must have at least one pure sequence and one or more sets or impure sequences. The game can continue for several rounds, with the player with the lowest score at the end of all rounds being the winner.
                        </li>
                        <li className="li-points">
                            Key rules include declaring a valid hand with at least one pure sequence and a combination of sets or impure sequences. If a player declares with an invalid hand, they receive a penalty of 60 points in 61 Pool or 80 points in 101/201 Pool. Players may drop the game in the initial or middle stage but incur penalties for dropping early.
                        </li>
                        <li className="li-points">

Points Rummy is a fast-paced, competitive rummy variant that requires strategy, focus, and quick decision-making.
