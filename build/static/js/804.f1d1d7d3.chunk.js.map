Additionally, it is a rapid format since there are fewer cards in play. You may even spend your lunch break playing the exciting game of 13-card rummy. You can do it whenever you want. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\"> <strong>Game Based on Skills: </strong>The game of rummy demands quick thinking and strategic planning. Math and the game itself must be understood in order to play. You grow better at it the more you play. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\"> <strong>Exciting and Fun-Filled: </strong>You never know when you will have a winning hand. A joker can arrive just in time and change the entire course of the game you’re playing. This makes it exciting. Playing against other top-skilled players keeps you on your toes and it ends up being so much fun.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>The Objective of 13 Card Rummy Game</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Sorting your cards into sets and sequences is the game's goal. The game is won by the first player to do this and then make a legitimate claim. However, devoted gamers will be aware that following the rules is necessary to play the game and eventually win.</p>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>At least two players should be present.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>Players must draw one card and discard one card throughout their turn.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>The cards are dealt to each player in sets or sequences.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>The winner is the first player to make a legitimate statement.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n            <h3>The 13 Card Rummy Game's Rules</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">While rummy has similar rules across versions, the Indian format differs from international variants. Here are the main rummy rules of the 13-card variant on RummyLudo.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>Creating Sequences</h2>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">A valid declaration in RummyLudo requires sequences. Every valid declaration must include at least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence.</p>\r\n            <h3>Pure Sequence: </h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">A pure sequence is formed by arranging at least three consecutive cards of the same suit without using a joker or a wild card joker. However, if a wild card joker naturally fits into the sequence and matches the suit of the other cards, it can be used as well.</p>\r\n            <strong>Example:</strong>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>2♠, 3♠, 4♠</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <h3>Impure Sequence: </h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">An impure sequence is formed when one or more jokers (including wild card jokers) are used to replace missing cards in a sequence.</p>\r\n            <strong>Example:</strong>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>2♠, printed joker, 4♠</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>or 2♠, wild card joker, 4♠</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <h3>Creating Sets</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">A set is made by grouping cards of the same value but from different suits.</p>\r\n            <strong>Example:</strong>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>6♦, 6♠, 6♥ creates a valid set</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <h3>More Rules for Sets:</h3>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>A set must have at least three cards.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>All cards in a set should be from different suits. If two cards in a set share the same suit, the set is invalid.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>A set cannot have more than four cards, each from a different suit.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>A valid declaration does not necessarily require a set if valid sequences are already present.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>Jokers (including wild card jokers) can be used to complete a set.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <h3>Printed Joker and Wild Card Jokers</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Jokers play a crucial role in RummyLudo, as they are versatile and can replace any missing card in a sequence or set.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">There are two types of jokers in every RummyLudo game:</p>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'><strong>Printed Joker: </strong>These jokers are included in the deck. Each deck of cards has at least two printed jokers.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'><strong>Wild Card Joker: </strong>At the start of each game, a card is randomly drawn to become the wild card joker. Any card of the same rank from other suits will act as a joker as well. For example, if the six of hearts is selected as a wild card joker, the six of diamonds, six of spades, and six of clubs can all be used as jokers. If a joker card is drawn initially, all aces automatically become wild cards for that game.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Playing on RummyLudo means understanding these rules to make valid declarations and improving your chances of winning!</p>\r\n            <h3>How to Play 13 Card Rummy</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">As mentioned earlier, the objective in every game of rummy is to arrange all your cards into sets and sequences, followed by making a valid declaration. The first player to do so wins the game. Here’s how to play 13-card rummy on RummyLudo.</p>\r\n            <h3>Shuffle and Dealing of Cards</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Every RummyLudo game begins with 13 cards delivered to each participant. There are two-player and six-player games to pick from. Your 13 cards will be sent to you instantly as soon as you join a table.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">The card-shuffling mechanism used by RummyLudo is approved by RNG (Random Number Generator) technology, ensuring impartial and equitable shuffling.</p>\r\n            <h3>Open Card</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">The system tosses to decide who will play first once each player has been given 13 cards. The person who has the highest value card \"wins\" the toss and gets to play first. Each player is dealt a card that represents them. RummyLudo's approach begins the game by randomly choosing a \"open card\" from the deck to symbolize the discard pile prior to the initial move.</p>\r\n            <h3>Declaration of Wild Card Joker</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">A card with all the characteristics of a printed joker is chosen at random from the closed pile to serve as the wild card joker at the start of each game. For that round, any card of the same rank regardless of suit is also regarded as a wild card joker.</p>\r\n            <h3>Drawing and Discarding Cards During a Game</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Players are required to draw one card and discard one card throughout their turn. They have the option of selecting the top card from the discard pile or drawing from the closed pile. Players are required to discard one card of their choosing into the discard (open) pile after drawing a card.</p>\r\n            <h3>Making a Valid Declaration</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Making a legitimate statement and winning the game is the best feeling in the world! What you need know about legitimate statements on RummyLudo is as follows:</p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">At least two sequences, one of which must be a pure sequence, are required for a declaration to be considered legitimate.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">As long as you have two sequences (including one pure sequence), there is no limit on the number of sets.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">A valid statement does not need a set of cards; all cards might be in sequence.Knowing these procedures and guidelines can help you make rapid, calculated movements on RummyLudo and improve your chances of winning. Take a seat at a table and begin playing right now!</p>\r\n            <h3>How Points are Calculated in a 13 Card Rummy Game</h3>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Additionally, the first person to make a legitimate statement loses all points. The goal of the game is for each player to create sets and sequences in order to reach zero points. The points earned by other players will range from 2 to 80. This will convert into cash while playing rummy with real money. As a result, it's crucial to always aim to get rid of as many valuable cards as you can. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">The scoring process is as follows: </p>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>Wild card jokers and printed jokers are worth zero points. </li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>Jack, queen, and king face cards are worth ten points. </li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>Ten points are awarded for idle ace cards that don't belong to a set or sequence.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">The points are printed on cards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. </p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">The value of cards automatically decreases to zero as they are merged into sets, impure sequences, and pure sequences. Note that for other sets and impure sequences to lose their aggregate worth, a pure sequence must be in play.</p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">When you quit a game, you are also penalized. Thus, the penalty mechanism for a Points Rummy game operates as follows: </p>\r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>20 points for the first drop.</li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>40 points is the middle drop. </li>\r\n              <li className='li-points'>80 points for an invalid declaration.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["ThertheenRummy","navigate","useNavigate","_jsx","_Fragment","children","_jsxs","className","style","onClick","cursor"],"sourceRoot":""}
