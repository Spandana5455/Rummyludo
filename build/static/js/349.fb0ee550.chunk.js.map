These operators file quarterly TDS returns with the government using Form 26Q. Once deducted, players can claim credit for TDS in their Income Tax Return under Section 199.

They should mention the gross amount of winnings and claim TDS credit. If winnings are less than ₹10,000, no TDS will be deducted, but they must still report the income in their ITR and pay tax.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"para\">Winnings from rummy are treated as income under the \"Other Sources\" heading and taxed at a 30% rate, regardless of the player's total income. Players should maintain records of their winnings, TDS deductions, and related documents. If their total income is below the taxable limit, they can file for a refund of the TDS deducted.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["TdsFilling","navigate","useNavigate","_jsx","_Fragment","children","_jsxs","className","style","onClick","cursor"],"sourceRoot":""}
