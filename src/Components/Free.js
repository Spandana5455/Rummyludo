          <h3>Points Rummy</h3>
          <p className="para">One of the quickest methods to play the game is with points rummy. The objective of the game is to organize your cards into sets and sequences such that you eventually have zero points, as the name implies. In the end, the winner is the first player to make a legitimate statement.</p>
          <p className="para">In this variation, each card has a predetermined value (or points). Ace: 10 points. Jack, Queen, and King (sometimes called face cards) are worth ten points each. Wild card or printed joker: 0 points. The same points as the value indicated on the cards are awarded for numerical cards.</p>
          <p className="para">The scoring process is as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li >You will lose twenty points if you leave the game on your first turn.</li>
            <li className='li-points' >Dropping from a game after that results in a 40-point penalty.</li>
            <li className='li-points' >An invalid declaration carries a penalty of 80 points.</li>
            <li className='li-points' >You won't lose any money on these games because you have decided to play a practice game. But even if you win, you won't get any thrilling financial rewards.</li>
          </ol>
