                        In Pool Rummy, each player starts with 0 points, and points are added based on ungrouped cards at the end of each round. Players continue playing until they reach or exceed a set limit (like 101 or 201 points). Once a player crosses this limit, they are eliminated. The last player remaining wins the entire prize pool.

                            In Pool Rummy, players aim to avoid accumulating points and stay in the game. Each round, players form valid sequences and sets from 13 dealt cards. The goal is to make a valid declaration with at least two sequences, one of which must be pure (without jokers). The game ends when only one player remains, with others eliminated upon reaching a set point limit (such as 61, 101, or 201).
