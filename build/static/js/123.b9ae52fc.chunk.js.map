That extra card could be used at some point (perhaps in a different sequence or as part of a set). It makes sense, though, to get rid of any idle cards that may interfere with your gameplay. If you have two Queen of Hearts cards, for instance, attempt to discard one if it is lying idle. since they are valuable cards as well.</p>\r\n          <h3>Throw Away Expensive Cards </h3>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">Having an idle high-value card is not a smart idea. They ought to be among the first things you attempt to get rid of. if you own valuable cards such as the Ace of Spades, King of Hearts, etc. First, check if you can put them in a set or a sequence. Throw them out as soon as possible if it doesn't work. In this manner, you will lose by less points if your opponent makes a legitimate statement before you. Please be aware, though, that other gamers will follow suit. Waiting two to three turns is thus advised since you might be able to obtain a high-value card that has been discarded and could be useful to you.</p>\r\n          <h3>Use the Wild Card Joker and Printed Joker Wisely </h3>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">The joker is the biggest game-changer in the rummy game. Getting a joker at a crucial moment in the game will determine whether you lose or win. Be careful not to throw away any jokers, whether they are printed or wild card jokers. Above all, make good use of them. Be sure to arrange them in groupings of high-value cards or in succession.</p>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">For example, </p>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">Suppose you have 2❤️ and 3❤️, and you also have 8❤️ and 9❤️. The joker should be grouped with 9❤️ and 8❤️. due to the fact that certain cards are worth more points. </p>\r\n          <h3>What Are Sequences?</h3>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">A sequence is also called a run. A sequence is created when three or more successive cards of the same suit are grouped together. Sequences come in two varieties.</p>\r\n          <h3>Pure Sequence</h3>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">Three or more consecutive cards that belong to the same suit make up this cluster. The joker card is not used in these sequences. Note that if a wild card joker is of the same suit as the other cards in the sequence and fits in the sequential order, it can still be utilized in a pure sequence.  </p>\r\n          <h4>This is an illustration of a pure sequence:</h4>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li className=\"li-points\"> 6 ♥</li>\r\n            <li className=\"li-points\"> 7 ♥</li>\r\n            <li className=\"li-points\"> 8 ♥</li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">Up to ten cards can form a pure sequence. </p>\r\n          <h3>Impure Sequence</h3>\r\n          <p className=\"para\"> The sequence will be completed by the joker/wildcard in this grouping. </p>\r\n          <p className=\"para\"> 5 ♥ J 🃟 7 ♥ 8 ♥ </p>\r\n          <p className=\"para\"> Here, the sequence is completed by substituting the joker for the six hearts. As long as the other sequence is pure, you can have up to ten cards in a sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n          <h3>Make Pure Sequences at the Earliest</h3>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">For someone to make a legitimate assertion, a pure sequence is absolutely necessary. If you don't have a pure sequence, it won't matter how many impure sets and sequences you have. Making ensuring you produce a pure sequence as quickly as possible should thus be your first focus throughout a game. </p>\r\n          <p>Assume you own the following cards.</p>\r\n          <ol>\r\n            <li className=\"li-points\"> 5 ♥</li>\r\n            <li className=\"li-points\"> 6 ♥</li>\r\n            <li className=\"li-points\"> 9 ♥</li>\r\n          </ol>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"para\">If you obtain an 8❤️, utilize it in place of the joker you inserted between them. </p>\r\n          <p className=\"para\">Please be aware that if you do not have a pure sequence from the beginning, it might be wise to drop out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n          <h1>Rummy Tips and Tricks FAQs</h1>\r\n          <div className=\"accordion\" id=\"rummyFAQ\">\r\n            {faqs.map((faq, index) => (\r\n              <div className=\"accordion-item mt-4 \" key={index} style={{ borderColor: '#86600D' }}>\r\n                <h2 className=\"accordion-header \" id={`heading${index}`} >\r\n                  <button\r\n                    className=\"accordion-button fw-bold\"\r\n                    type=\"button\"\r\n\r\n                    data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\r\n                    data-bs-target={`#collapse${index}`}\r\n                    aria-expanded={index === 0 ? \"true\" : \"false\"}\r\n                    aria-controls={`collapse${index}`}\r\n                    style={{ backgroundColor: 'grey', color: '#fff' }}\r\n                  >\r\n                    {index + 1}. {faq.question}\r\n                  </button>\r\n                </h2>\r\n                <div\r\n                  id={`collapse${index}`}\r\n                  className={`accordion-collapse collapse ${index === 0 ? \"show\" : \"\"}`}\r\n                  aria-labelledby={`heading${index}`}\r\n                  data-bs-parent=\"#rummyFAQ\"\r\n                >\r\n                  <div className=\"accordion-body\" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: faq.answer }} />\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            ))}\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["Tips","navigate","useNavigate","faqs","question","answer","_jsx","_Fragment","children","_jsxs","className","style","onClick","cursor","id","map","faq","index","borderColor","type","backgroundColor","color","dangerouslySetInnerHTML","__html"],"sourceRoot":""}
