          <p className="para">
            Indian Rummy is a popular variation of the 13-card rummy game, played with 2 to 6 players. It involves skill, strategy, and concentration, and is played with two standard 52-card decks and Jokers. The primary objective is to form valid sequences and sets to declare and win the game. Players are dealt 13 cards at the start, and they take turns to pick a card from the open or closed deck. Printed Jokers can substitute any card to form a valid sequence or set, while wild Jokers are randomly selected. A valid declaration means the player has successfully arranged all their 13 cards into combinations of sequences and sets. Points are calculated based on ungrouped cards in a player's hand, with the lowest-scoring player winning. Indian Rummy is a social and engaging card game that combines skill and strategy.

                <p>
                  Points Rummy is one of the fastest and most straightforward formats, ideal for quick games. Each card carries a specific point value, with numbered cards worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) worth 10 points, and Aces worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on the playerâ€™s choice. The game continues until one player declares, meaning they have completed their sets and sequences. The remaining players calculate their points based on the cards left in their hands, and the player with the lowest points wins the round. The simplicity and speed of Points Rummy make it popular for casual play and for those looking to enjoy quick rounds without extensive setup or strategy.

                <p>Pool Rummy adds a layer of strategy to the game by introducing a limit on the number of points players can accumulate. It is usually played with either 101 or 201 points, depending on the agreed-upon rules. Players aim to keep their scores below the specified limit, and the game continues until one player exceeds it, leading to their elimination. The last remaining player wins the game. This format encourages players to be strategic about the cards they pick and discard, as managing points becomes crucial to avoid elimination. The competitive nature of Pool Rummy appeals to players who enjoy a more strategic and long-term game.</p>

Players play a predetermined number of deals, and after each deal, scores are calculated based on the cards left in hand. The player with the lowest score at the end of all deals wins. This format allows for deeper strategies and a more prolonged engagement, as players must consider their performance over multiple rounds rather than just a single game.

          <h1>How Points are Calculated in Indian Rummy</h1>
          <p className="para">The objective of rummy is to get your score down to zero, which is an interesting fact. This is due to the fact that every player has a negative score after receiving their cards. The value that is printed on each card is its actual worth. For example, a three of spades will have a value of three. A six of hearts will be worth six. Jack, King, Queen, and Aces are worth ten.</p>
