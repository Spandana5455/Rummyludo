      answer: `
        <ul>
          <li><b>Form Pure Sequence First:</b> A pure sequence is necessary to avoid hefty penalties in case of a drop or loss. Prioritize creating a pure sequence from the start.</li>
          <li><b>Keep an Eye on Opponents:</b> Monitor the cards your opponents are picking or discarding. This helps you guess their strategy and prevents you from discarding a card they may need.</li>
        </ul>
      `,

    {
      question: "How do I decide which cards to discard?",
      answer: `
        <ul>
          <li><b>Discard High-Value Cards:</b> If you‚Äôre holding high-point cards like Kings, Queens, and Aces without forming a sequence or set, discard them to minimize losses.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid Giving Useful Cards:</b> Be cautious about discarding cards that could complete sequences or sets for your opponents.</li>
        </ul>

      question: "What‚Äôs the best way to use Jokers?",
      answer: `
        <p><b>Use Jokers Wisely:</b> Jokers are versatile, so use them in sets or sequences that are hard to complete. However, avoid using Jokers in pure sequences, as they won‚Äôt count.</p>
      `,
    },
    {
      question: "What is a Pure Sequence, and why is it important?",
      answer: `
        <p>A pure sequence is a consecutive set of cards of the same suit without a Joker. It‚Äôs mandatory to have at least one pure sequence to declare, as it makes your hand eligible for a win and reduces the points if you lose.</p>
      `,
    },
    {
      question: "Is it a good strategy to pick from the discard pile?",
      answer: `
        <p>Picking from the discard pile reveals your intentions to other players. Only pick from this pile if it significantly improves your hand or completes a crucial sequence.</p>

      question: "How can I use bluffing in Rummy?",
      answer: `
        <p><b>Fake Discards:</b> Discarding cards in a pattern may trick your opponents into guessing your hand incorrectly. Bluffing can keep them from accessing certain cards.</p>
      `,
    },
    {
      question: "How should I handle multiple Jokers?",
      answer: `
        <p>Use multiple Jokers to quickly complete a second sequence or difficult sets. Avoid placing all Jokers in one sequence, as it limits their utility.</p>
      `,

    {
      question: "What is a middle card strategy?",
      answer: `
        <p><b>Middle Cards Are Versatile:</b> Cards like 5, 6, and 7 can easily form sequences, as they can link to both lower and higher values. Holding middle cards increases the chance of completing sequences faster.</p>
      `,

    {
      question: "Should I go for a quick declaration or build a strong hand?",
      answer: `
        <p>This depends on your opponents‚Äô game style and the cards you have. If you have a valid declaration with a strong hand, consider declaring early. However, rushing without proper validation can lead to penalties.</p>

          <h3>Pro Tips And Strategies to ‚ÄòAce‚Äô the Game</h3>
          <p className="para">The following tips are worth attempting when playing Indian Rummy.</p>
          <h3>Attempt to Throw Out Duplicate Cards </h3>
          <p className="para">Try to discard one card as quickly as you can if you are dealt two cards of the same value from the same suit. That extra card could be used at some point (perhaps in a different sequence or as part of a set). It makes sense, though, to get rid of any idle cards that may interfere with your gameplay. If you have two Queen of Hearts cards, for instance, attempt to discard one if it is lying idle. since they are valuable cards as well.</p>
          <h3>Throw Away Expensive Cards </h3>
          <p className="para">Having an idle high-value card is not a smart idea. They ought to be among the first things you attempt to get rid of. if you own valuable cards such as the Ace of Spades, King of Hearts, etc. First, check if you can put them in a set or a sequence. Throw them out as soon as possible if it doesn't work. In this manner, you will lose by less points if your opponent makes a legitimate statement before you. Please be aware, though, that other gamers will follow suit. Waiting two to three turns is thus advised since you might be able to obtain a high-value card that has been discarded and could be useful to you.</p>
          <h3>Use the Wild Card Joker and Printed Joker Wisely </h3>
          <p className="para">The joker is the biggest game-changer in the rummy game. Getting a joker at a crucial moment in the game will determine whether you lose or win. Be careful not to throw away any jokers, whether they are printed or wild card jokers. Above all, make good use of them. Be sure to arrange them in groupings of high-value cards or in succession.</p>
          <p className="para">For example, </p>
          <p className="para">Suppose you have 2‚ù§Ô∏è and 3‚ù§Ô∏è, and you also have 8‚ù§Ô∏è and 9‚ù§Ô∏è. The joker should be grouped with 9‚ù§Ô∏è and 8‚ù§Ô∏è. due to the fact that certain cards are worth more points. </p>
          <h3>What Are Sequences?</h3>
          <p className="para">A sequence is also called a run. A sequence is created when three or more successive cards of the same suit are grouped together. Sequences come in two varieties.</p>
          <h3>Pure Sequence</h3>
          <p className="para">Three or more consecutive cards that belong to the same suit make up this cluster. The joker card is not used in these sequences. Note that if a wild card joker is of the same suit as the other cards in the sequence and fits in the sequential order, it can still be utilized in a pure sequence.  </p>
          <h4>This is an illustration of a pure sequence:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li className="li-points"> 6 ‚ô•</li>
            <li className="li-points"> 7 ‚ô•</li>
            <li className="li-points"> 8 ‚ô•</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="para">Up to ten cards can form a pure sequence. </p>
          <h3>Impure Sequence</h3>
          <p className="para"> The sequence will be completed by the joker/wildcard in this grouping. </p>
          <p className="para"> 5 ‚ô• J üÉü 7 ‚ô• 8 ‚ô• </p>
          <p className="para"> Here, the sequence is completed by substituting the joker for the six hearts. As long as the other sequence is pure, you can have up to ten cards in a sequence.</p>

          <h3>Make Pure Sequences at the Earliest</h3>
          <p className="para">For someone to make a legitimate assertion, a pure sequence is absolutely necessary. If you don't have a pure sequence, it won't matter how many impure sets and sequences you have. Making ensuring you produce a pure sequence as quickly as possible should thus be your first focus throughout a game. </p>
          <p>Assume you own the following cards.</p>
          <ol>
            <li className="li-points"> 5 ‚ô•</li>
            <li className="li-points"> 6 ‚ô•</li>
            <li className="li-points"> 9 ‚ô•</li>
          </ol>

          <p className="para">If you obtain an 8‚ù§Ô∏è, utilize it in place of the joker you inserted between them. </p>
          <p className="para">Please be aware that if you do not have a pure sequence from the beginning, it might be wise to drop out.</p>
