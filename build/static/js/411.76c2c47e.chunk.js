Players are dealt 13 cards at the start, and they take turns to pick a card from the open or closed deck. Printed Jokers can substitute any card to form a valid sequence or set, while wild Jokers are randomly selected. A valid declaration means the player has successfully arranged all their 13 cards into combinations of sequences and sets.
